Follow [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask#_run-the-app-in-the-debugger) to run the app in the debugger.

# Static Type Checking
Static type checkers are tools that analyze code to ensure type correctness before runtime, providing an added layer of validation in dynamically typed languages like Python. Similar to how TypeScript enhances JavaScript by introducing static types, static type checkers like Mypy bring the benefits of type safety to Python. These tools help developers catch potential errors early in the development process, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.

Follow [this guide](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started.html) to add Mypy to your project.

Adding a .toml file to your project and setting `strict = true` file to your project will let you set the
